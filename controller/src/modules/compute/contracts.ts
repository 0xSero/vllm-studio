/**
 * The compute layer's contracts. This file has no runtime imports and no I/O — it is
 * the only module every other compute file may depend on.
 *
 * Three rules carry the design:
 *   1. Engines are pure. `plan()` is a total function of its request; no clock, no env,
 *      no filesystem. That is what makes the whole launch path golden-testable.
 *   2. The instance record is the lease. A device is held iff a live record claims it,
 *      so there is no registry to fall out of sync with reality.
 *   3. Status is derived, never stored. `stateOf` reads liveness, then health, then the
 *      deadline — there is no status field to go stale.
