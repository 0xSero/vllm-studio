//
// Disk-backed memo for per-rollout derived data.
//
// Two things a session open needs — the active-branch id set and the lifetime
// usage totals — cost a full pass over the rollout to compute. Both are already
// memoised in process on (size, mtime). That is not enough: the expensive
// sessions are the large ones, and a controller restart drops every entry, so
// the first open of a big session after a restart re-pays the whole thing. On
// the largest rollout on this machine (3.56 GB) that is ~25s for the branch
// walk alone.
//
// Persisting the same memo turns once-per-process into once-ever.
//
// The cache is strictly derived data: a miss, a corrupt file, an unwritable
// directory, and a schema change all degrade to "recompute", never to an error
// and never to a wrong answer. Nothing here is authoritative.
