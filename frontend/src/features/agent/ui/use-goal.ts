 * early is held here and written by `flushPendingGoal` the moment the session
 * earns its id.
 *
 * That pending objective is keyed by the TAB that queued it. This hook is
 * pane-wide but `flushPendingGoal` fires for whichever session next earns an
 * id, so an unkeyed ref let a `/goal` typed in one tab land on a different
 * tab's session — with resetTurns, which clobbers that session's real goal.
 *
 * Goal mode: selecting /goal with nothing typed flips the composer into a
 * mode — a Target pill, a goal placeholder — and the next submit sets the
 * objective AND dispatches it as the opening turn so the agent starts pursuing
 * immediately. Setting a goal on an idle session used to do nothing until the
 * next message, because the continuation driver only fires on turn-settle. */
