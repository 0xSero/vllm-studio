/**
 * Every tool output, file preview, diff and code block in the timeline scrolls
 * inside one of these.
 *
 * The problem this solves is layout shift while a turn streams. A `max-h` box
 * grows line by line as output arrives, so everything below it — the rest of
 * the transcript, the composer — slides down on every chunk, and the reader
 * loses their place mid-sentence. ChatGPT never does this: a preview claims its
 * space once and then scrolls inside it.
 *
 * So the height *latches*. While content is short the box hugs it (a two-line
 * `ls` should not reserve 320px of nothing). The first time content would
 * exceed the cap the box locks to exactly the cap and never resizes again, even
 * if the content later shrinks — one settle, then stillness.
 *
 * `stickToBottom` keeps the newest output visible the way a terminal does, but
 * only while the reader is already at the bottom. Scrolling up to read
 * something is a deliberate act and streaming must not yank you back down.
