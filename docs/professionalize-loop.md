# Professionalize Loop — Mission Ledger

**Started:** 2026-07-12 18:05 EDT · **Deadline:** 2026-07-13 06:05 EDT (12h)
**Branch:** `loop/professionalize` (off origin/main @ 41a0bc45) · **Mode:** self-paced /loop, autonomous

## Mission
Turn the repo into something more professional: improve code quality, remove trash, update docs,
clean package.json, find and debug bugs, Effect V4 everywhere (controller), extract components
and logic, keep code DRY.

## Standing rules
- All work lands on `loop/professionalize`; push after each iteration. **Never merge to main**
  (semantic-release fires on main) — final PR at the end.
- **No deploys to pop-os** (controller restart kills the running model). Repo-only work.
- Never delete non-git data files. Deleting dead *tracked* code is fine (git preserves it).
- Gates per iteration: controller → `bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test:unit`;
  frontend → `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` (+ targeted tests); full `npm run check`
  every ~4 iterations and before the final PR.
- Commit style: conventional commits, one concern per commit.
- Respect the instrument-sheet aesthetic; no visual redesigns.
- SKIP lists from previous loops are binding (controller-simplification items 6–8: do not re-propose).

## Backlog (priority order; ✔ = done, ▶ = in progress)
1. ✔ I1a: Carry over verified keepalive fix (a89bc95b → e956b021).
2. I1b: **Gates actually enforced** — add root `check:contracts` + `check:structure` job to CI;
   prune stale `environments.ts` entry in validate-shared-contracts.mjs; fix stale AGENTS.md
   test-runner doc (`tsx --test` → `bun test scripts`).
3. I2: **Trash removal** — empty `cli/` stub dir (tracked refs), knip/depcheck dead-export sweep
   in frontend+controller, dead `PROGRESS.md`?, stale docs/mockups review (keep mockups, they're design refs).
4. I3: **package.json cleaning** — root+frontend+controller: stale scripts, unused deps
   (depcheck), align engines fields, dedupe config (jscpd threshold drift, knip hoisting → issue #146).
5. I4: **Test story** — rename `tests/frontend/e2e` (it's node:test, not e2e), standardize on
   bun:test, add frontend unit tests to root `check`, document in AGENTS.md.
6. I5: **AggregatedSession + contracts seam** — move cross-boundary types to shared/contracts;
   prune validator whitelist.
7. I6: **Collapse per-backend upgrade routes** into `/runtime/:backend/upgrade` (issue #145);
   split engines/routes.ts god-router by concern (recipes / lifecycle / downloads / runtime).
8. I7: **DRY sweeps** — duplicate `ps` parsers (process-utilities vs process-manager);
   the two SSE keepalive implementations (http/sse.ts vs chat-completions-stream.ts);
   per-field route validators (rig-routes hand-rolled parsers → shared request-validation helpers).
9. I8: **Effect V4 deepening (controller)** — controller already uses effect@4.0.0-beta.90 in
   core/command.ts; migrate promise-tangles (engine-coordinator setActiveRecipe phases,
   download-manager, runtime jobs) to Effect where it *reduces* complexity. No wholesale rewrite.
10. I9: **EngineSpec deepening** — move per-engine command/probe/install/runtime-info bodies into
    specs/*.ts; unify the 4 "what's installed" paths on RuntimeTarget discovery.
11. I10: **Frontend session-status module** — single `settleSession`/`startTurn`/`isSessionWorking`
    in features/agent/runtime; replace the 3+ inline copies (controller L137, engine L213, applier).
12. I11: **defineAgentRoute scaffold** — collapse ~25 in-process agent API route boilerplates.
13. I12: **Component extraction** — largest frontend files (query for >400-line .tsx) into
    model/view pairs per existing convention.
14. I13: **Docs refresh** — README accuracy pass, AGENTS.md route map vs reality, controller
    route map in memory vs actual, CONTEXT.md seed (domain vocabulary) if time allows.
15. I14: **Model-profile table** — unify launch parsers (model-runtime-defaults.ts) + streaming
    quirks (proxy/reasoning.ts) behind one table. CAREFUL: decode-path — verify content fields,
    not just green tests.
16. Final: full `npm run check`, write PR summary, open PR to main, PushNotification.

## Iteration log
- **I1 (18:05)**: Branch created. Recovered keepalive fix via cherry-pick (e956b021) after a
  stash mishap (old stash@{0} briefly popped; resurrected files parked in scratchpad/old-stash-files;
  stash entry preserved untouched). Starting I1b.
