# vLLM Studio Cleanup Mission Status

## Mission

Clean up vLLM Studio without changing runtime functionality or UI unless a later checklist item explicitly requires it. Every slice must be validated, committed, and released when appropriate.

## Current Turn

- [x] Inspect frontend e2e coverage and workspace tab-forking behavior.
- [x] Add e2e coverage for forking a tab into a split pane with fresh identity.
- [x] Add e2e coverage for forking while already split replacing the sibling pane instead of adding a third pane.
- [x] Validate frontend e2e coverage slice.
- [x] Commit this slice.

## Backlog

- [ ] Add frontend e2e coverage for agent flows: splitting, leaving and reconnecting sessions, forking, compacting, pi-extensions, tagging files, and skills. Initial regression coverage exists for reconnect, splitting, queue/follow-up, compacting, skills, file tagging, Pi extension override persistence, and tab forking; browser screenshot coverage and extension UI remain.
- [ ] Add settings e2e coverage and implement direct MLX and llama.cpp support.
- [ ] Improve venv management experience.
- [ ] Clean controller dead paths and unused complexity based on code and logs.
- [ ] Add controller integration and e2e tests for all active controller flows. Initial integration smoke coverage exists for core route contracts; full active-flow coverage remains.
- [ ] Add controller observability for success, failure, error, path, and function-call tracking. Initial persistent HTTP route observability exists; per-function call tracking remains.
- [ ] Surface observability data in `/usage` and validate it end to end. Initial route observability is surfaced and integration-tested; frontend usage rendering and full API-route coverage remain.
- [ ] Deploy controller to Pop!\_OS after killing the old controller from this device.
- [ ] Test every API route against controller observability rows and `/usage`.
- [ ] Audit comments across the repo and delete stale or irrelevant comments. Current slice removes empty/generated JSDoc blocks from controller source and tooling; broader file-by-file audit remains open.
- [ ] Audit package scripts and remove irrelevant commands. Current slice removes stale root frontend metadata/dependencies, duplicate frontend quality alias, and broken nested Husky prepare scripts; deeper command pruning remains open as features are removed.
- [x] Replace every React effect hook with appropriate alternatives and validate there are zero remaining frontend source usages.

## Constraints

- Do not change functionality unless a checklist item explicitly requires it.
- Do not change UI unless a checklist item explicitly requires it.
- Keep tests in dedicated modules when adding them later: `tests/controller/integration`, `tests/controller/e2e`, and `tests/frontend/e2e`.
- Keep this file updated as work advances.
